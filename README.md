# Client Handbook

Clients are frequently uncertain about what inputs are required for our
projects, and how to interact with our process and toolset.

When on-boarding a new client and their team,
we should provide them with the following information:

* What our design and development process looks like
* How they contribute to the process
* What the roles of Craftsmen team are
* Set expectations about their responsibilities

This repo contains the documents that should be sent out
after sales agreements are signed and encouraged to be shared with the client's entire team.
